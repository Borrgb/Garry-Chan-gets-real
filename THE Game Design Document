GAME OVERVIEW 
Garry-Chan gets real is an egg-like, or an "ironic and incoherent collectathon"
The gameplay is meant to be fast and without limits, though still controllable and never infuriating.
The game is meant to be silly, not to be taken seriously. But it still has to be good, of course.

GAMEPLAY
The objective of the game is to collect everything described on the next line, and to create Garry-Chan, who is also the player character (paradoxical!)
collect 15 magical cubes, 7 sun vertices, 3 roses from the rose thorn forest and 20 globs of essence. then, defeat the green skull using the drywall screw to create Garry-Chan
There are also optional collectibles that are either linked to quests or give you rewards.
You have to collect these items by travelling through various worlds which host a large amount of characters, a lot of which have quests linked to them.
Quests can vary greatly, but most will have you either going somewhere and collecting a thing, talking to another character or finding something
Every level is linked in with eachother, so there's multiple ways to enter each level.
